# Study-of-User-features-and-Social-networks-for-Topic-Modeling
In recent years, social media platforms, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram, have gained in popularity and have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, where rich user-generated texts are propagated through them. The existing topic models focus on traditional document collections, which consists of a relatively small number of long and high-quality documents. However, user-generated texts tend to be shorter and noisier than traditional content. Besides, the social networks have two novel features: context information on nodes, such as user features, and edges, such as relationships, which have not been considered by the existing topic models.


In this project, we have addressed the problem of finding user topics in a large-scale collection of documents from online social networks. We have tried to design a comprehensive feature-based and social-based topic model, taking into account and model the user features and social network.
